##### Modes #####
### Specify how you want to simulate the scenario ###
# Options: sim, neg_depb_to_oppb, neg_oppb_to_depb, service_optimization.
# sim runs a single simulation with the given inputs.
# neg_depb_to_oppb changes negative depb-rotations to oppb charging.
# neg_oppb_to_depb changes negative oppb-rotations to depb charging.
# service_optimization finds the largest set of electrified rotations.
# station_optimization finds the set of fewest stations to electrify all rotations.
# report generates simulation output files, including costs.

##### Flags #####
