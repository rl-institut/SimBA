Simulation Parameters
=====================

The simulation of an eBus-System relies on a variety of simulation parameters.
SimBA provides most of them as default values. Depending on specific needs adjusting
these values can increase the accuracy of the simulation outputs. The SimBA input files are described
in detail in the following subsections as well as their default parameters.
When providing the user defined input files, the user should make sure the files are either 'utf-8'
encoded or not contain regional characters.

.. _config:

Configuration
-------------
The configuration file config.cfg is provided as example in ./examples/ and provides the user with most of the functionality surrounding the settings and boundary conditions of a simulation. The config file is divided into several sections:

| Paths: Here all in- and output paths are defined
| Modes: Here the modes of execution can be defined
| Flags: Here, optional functionality can be activated or deactivated
| Physical setup of environment: Here, the physical setup is characterized
| Simulation Parameters: The simulation can be adjusted using these paramteres

The example (data/simba.cfg) contains parameter descriptions which are explained here in more detail:

Schedule
--------

To analyze your own electric bus schedule, the data needs to be provided as a .csv file where each row contains the details of a single trip of that schedule. Find the details about the various columns in this file below. The first table lists the **mandatory** columns while the second one (tbd) lists optional parameters. Refer to `data/examples/trips.csv` for an example.

.. list-table:: schedule mandatory input

Consumption table
-----------------
The consumption table can be referenced in the :ref:`vehicle_types` file. Instead of constant consumption SimBA uses provided temperatures, level of loadings, mean speeds, average inclines and the vehicle type to interpolate the consumption value from this data table. Level of loading and temperatures are read from the :ref:`schedule` if the trips provide them. If they are missing from the schedule, they are looked up from the files :ref:`level_of_loading` and :ref:`temperature_data`. The average incline is calculated from :ref:`station_geo_data` and the mean speed is calculated by using the departure and arrival time and distance provided by the schedule.
