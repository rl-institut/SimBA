.. _simulation_parameters:

Simulation Parameters
=====================

The simulation of an eBus-System relies on a variety of simulation parameters.
SimBA provides most of them as default values. Depending on specific needs adjusting
these values can increase the accuracy of the simulation outputs. The SimBA input files are described in detail in the following subsections as well as their default parameters. When providing the user defined input files, the user should make sure the files are either 'utf-8' encoded or not contain regional characters. Except for the ``electrified_stations.json``, all .json files can be enriched with in-line comments starting with :code:`\\\\`.

.. _config:

Configuration
-------------
The configuration file config.cfg is provided as example in ./examples/ and provides the user with most of the functionality surrounding the settings and boundary conditions of a simulation. The config file is divided into several sections:

| Paths: Here all in- and output paths are defined
| Modes: Here the modes of execution can be defined
| Flags: Here, optional functionality can be activated or deactivated
| Physical setup of environment: Here, the physical setup is characterized
| Simulation Parameters: The simulation can be adjusted using these parameters

The example (data/simba.cfg) contains parameter descriptions which are explained here in more detail:

.. _vehicle_types:

Vehicle types
-------------

The vehicle types that can be used are defined in the "vehicle_type.json". The path to this file has to be defined in the :ref:`config` and an example is given at "data/examples/vehicle_types.json".

The data is structured as a .json where the top level key represents the vehicle_type, that needs to correspond to the "vehicle_type" defined in the :ref:`schedule`. The next level key defines the charging_type ("oppb" or "depb"). For one vehicle type either one or both charging types can be defined and for each given charging type the specifications in the third level of the .json have to be given. In this level, the parameters for the specified vehicle are be defined. The specification of one vehicle with the vehicle_type "AB" and the charging_types "depb" and "oppb" is given as follows:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "AB": {  // vehicle_type
            "depb": {  // charging_type
                "name": "articulated bus - depot charging",  // long name
                "capacity": 250,  // battery capacity in kWh
                "charging_curve": [[0, 150], [0.8, 150], [1, 15]],  // charging curve [SoC, kW]
                "min_charging_power": 0,  // min charging power in KW
                "v2g": false,  // Is vehicle capable of vehicle to grid?
                "mileage": "data/examples/energy_consumption_example.csv",  // mileage in kWh/km or link to consumption.csv
                "battery_efficiency": 0.95  // optional. default: 0.95
            },
            "oppb": {
                "name": "articulated bus - opportunity charging",
                "capacity": 150,
                "charging_curve": [[0, 250], [0.8, 250], [1, 25]],
                "min_charging_power": 0,
                "v2g": false,
                "mileage": "data/examples/energy_consumption_example.csv"
            }
        }
    }

.. _electrified_stations:

Electrified stations
--------------------

All stations, that are or could be equipped with charging infrastructure have to be parameterized in the "electrified_stations.json" together with their grid connection, charging infrastructure and local energy systems. The path to this file has to be defined in the :ref:`config`.

The data is structured as a .json where the top level key represents the station name, that needs to correspond to the "departure_name", respectively "arrival_name" defined in the :ref:`schedule`. Each station has two mandatory arguments: "type" defines if a station is a depot ("deps") or an opportunity charging station ("opps") and "n_charging_stations" limits the amount of vehicles, that can simultaneously charge at one station.

Furthermore, the energy system at each station can be characterized in terms of local power generation ("energy_feed_in"), local external loads ("external_load") or local stationary electric power storage ("battery"). An example that displays all further parameters and the specification of the local energy systems is given at "data/examples/electrified_stations.json".


.. _cost_params:

Cost parameters
---------------
In order to run the :ref:`cost_calculation`, all cost parameters are to be defined in the ``cost_params.json``. The file is used as input for both, SimBA and SpiceEV, as both tools do part of the cost calculation and therefore no comments are allowed here. If not otherwise specified the investments/costs are gross prices. A commented example is given below, for a working example please refer to "data/examples/cost_params.json".

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "vehicles": {  // all vehicles and charging types have to be defined here
            "SB_debp": {  // all combinations of vehicle types and charging types have a separate cost definition, the name is to be given as [vehicle_type]_[charging_type]
                "capex": 500000,  // investment cost for one vehicle without vehicle battery
                "c_maint_per_km": 0.24,  // maintenance cost per km

            "cost_per_kWh": 250  // investment cost for vehicle battery per kWh
        },
        "gc": {  // grid connection
            "LV": {  // grid connection in specific voltage level. Options are "HV", "HV/MV", "MV", "MV/LV", "LV" and all relevant voltage levels have to be defined here
                "default_distance": 50,  // Used if not specified individually in electrified_stations.json
                "capex_gc_fix": 100,  // fix investment cost for establishing a grid connection
                "capex_gc_per_meter": 16.85,  // investment cost per meter
                "capex_gc_per_kW": 24.14,  // investment cost per kW

                "capex_transformer_per_kW": 0  // fix investment cost for a transformer per kW
            },
            "lifetime_gc": 50,  // lifetime of the grid connection in years
            "c_maint_transformer_per_year": 0.02,  // annual maintenance costs in % of capex

            "capex_per_kWh": 1,  //  investment cost for stationary storage per kWh
            "c_maint_stat_storage_per_year": 0.02,  // annual maintenance costs in % of capex
            "lifetime_stat_storage": 20  // lifetime in years
        },
        "cs":{  // charging stations

            "capex_deps_per_kW": 1000,  //  investment cost for depot charging stations per kW
            "lifetime_cs": 20,  // lifetime of charging stations in years
            "c_maint_cs_per_year": 0.02  // annual maintenance costs in % of capex
        },
        "garage": {
            "n_charging_stations": 1,  // number of charging stations for the garage

            "lifetime_workstations": 20  // lifetime in years
        }
    }

all remaining parameters are described in the example file.


.. _station_geo_data:

Station data
------------
The file "all_stations.csv" contains information that is relevant for all stations regardless of their status of electrification. At this stage of development this reduces to the information of station height that is relevant only if a trip specific :ref:`consumption_analysis` is employed. See the example at "data/examples/all_stations.csv" for the required structure.


.. _level_of_loading:

Level of loading
----------------

If a trip specific :ref:`consumption_analysis` is employed, the level of loading for each trip is required. This information can be detailed in the :ref:`schedule`. If not specified there, a default value for every hour of the day can be specified in this file. See the example at "data/examples/default_level_of_loading_over_day.csv" for the required structure.


.. _temperature_data:

Temperatures
------------
If a trip specific :ref:`consumption_analysis` is employed, the temperature for each trip is required. This information can be detailed in the :ref:`schedule`. If not specified there, a default value for every hour of the day can be specified in this file. See the example at "data/examples/default_temp_summer.csv" for the required structure.

.. _consumption_table:

Consumption table
-----------------
The consumption table can be referenced in the :ref:`vehicle_types` file. Instead of constant consumption SimBA uses provided temperatures, level of loadings, mean speeds, average inclines and the vehicle type to interpolate the consumption value from this data table. Level of loading and temperatures are read from the :ref:`schedule` if the trips provide them. If they are missing from the schedule, they are looked up from the files :ref:`level_of_loading` and :ref:`temperature_data`. The average incline is calculated from :ref:`station_geo_data` and the mean speed is calculated by using the departure and arrival time and distance provided by the schedule.
