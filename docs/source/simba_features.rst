.. _consumption_analysis:

Consumption analysis
--------------------

The consumption can be calculated in two ways: Either with a constant average specific consumption or with a trip specific consumption, where the consumption depends on the temperature, the incline, the level of loading and the average speed.

To use a constant consumption, this value can be defined in the :ref:`vehicle_types` as "mileage" in the unit of [kWh/km]. To use the trip specific consumption, a consumption table needs to be created with data for each vehicle type. The path to the consumption table is assigned to the variable "mileage" in :ref:`vehicle_types`. The consumption table should have the columns "vehicle_type", "level_of_loading", "incline" ,"mean_speed_kmh", "t_amb", "consumption_kwh_per_km" and its creation is at ths point of development not part of SimBA. The consumption for each trip is then calculated by interpolation of the datapoints provided in the table.

The level_of_loading describes the share between an empty vehicle (0) and a fully loaded vehicle (1) and can be handed over in two ways: Either directly as a column in :ref:`schedule` with specific values for each individual trip or as an input file "default_level_of_loading.csv" (path defined in :ref:`config`) containing values for each hour of the day. SimBA will first look into schedule and take this value and if it is not defined take the one from the .csv file. The temperature information is obtained in the same way as the level of loading and should be given in Â°C. In order to calculate the consumption based on the incline, an extra "all_stations.csv" file (path defined in :ref:`config`) has to be provided containing information on the elevation in m of each station. The incline is then calculated as the average incline between start and stop of the trip, which is an assumption that creates good results for vehicles with recuperation technology, as most electric vehicles have. The mean speed is calculated using the information provided in :ref:`schedule` about duration and length of each trip.


.. _vehicle_dispatch:

Vehicle Dispatch
----------------

To allocate the rotations to vehicles, vehicles of the needed type to fulfil the rotation are used. If no suitable vehicle is available, a new vehicle is created. The suitability depends on the chosen value of assign_strategy. Possible options are "adaptive" and "fixed_recharge". If no value is provided "adaptive" is used.


adaptive
###############
A vehicle is defined as "available" if it is currently not serving another rotation, is of the same vehicle type, is at the same depot and if it had approximately enough time after return to the depot to be charged to service the next rotation. If multiple vehicles can service the same rotation, the vehicle with a lower expected SoC after charging and before leaving is used. The dispatch differs between opportunity and depot rotations. A vehicle is only assigned to a depot rotation if its expected SoC at time of departure is equal or greater than a) the SoC needed for this rotation or b) the desired_soc from :refconfig. A vehicle can be assigned to an opportunity rotation if its SoC is less than the needed SoC, if the charge during the last standing time is enough to service the rotation or if the expected SoC is equal or greater than the desired_soc from :refconfig. This can happen when the previous rotation ended with a negative SoC. This design decision is made to simplify the expected mode chain of.

["sim", "neg_depb_to_oppb", "station_optimization", "report"]

This way depot rotations can not be negative because of their previous rotation and therefore not wrongly switched to opportunity rotations. Opportunity rotations can be negative because of their previous rotation, but this is handled during station_optimization. In these cases the rotation will not be negative when the previous rotation can be made positive by adding electrified stations.

The strategy considers the maximum available power of the current depot charging station, the default_buffer_time_deps and the charging curve of the vehicle. Since SoCs are calculated numerically which is different from SpiceEV the vehicle dispatch can lead to slightly negative rotations. The error is not expected to exceed -1%.


fixed recharge
###############
A vehicle is defined as "available" if it is currently not serving another rotation, has the same depot and if it had approximately enough time after return to the depot to be charged to a fixed value defined by min_recharge_deps_oppb or min_recharge_deps_depb from the :ref`config` together with the respective battery capacity of the vehicle and assuming the maximum available power of the current depot charging station. The default_buffer_time_deps and charging curve of the vehicle is not considered. This can lead to the dispatch of vehicles with less than the min_recharge values.



Charging simulation
-------------------

The charging simulation is carried out in the open source software `SpiceEV <https://github.com/rl-institut/spice_ev>`_, that is included in SimBA as a package. SimBA therefore uses SpiceEVs charging strategy "distributed", that allows to separate the charging strategy depending on the station type. The station types can be either depot charging station (deps) or opportunity charging station (opps). The charging strategy that is applied at depot and opportunity charging stations can be chosen in the config as "strategy_deps" respectively "strategy_opps", together with the strategy options. See the SpiceEV documentation for the description of all possible `strategies <https://spice-ev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/charging_strategies_incentives.html>`_ and  `options <https://spice-ev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simulating_with_spiceev.html#strategy-options>`_.

.. _generate_report:

Generate report
---------------

The generation of the report is implemented as a mode, that can be activated with the keyword "report" in modes (:ref:`report`). The report generates most of the output files. The report can be called any number of times e.g. mode = ["sim", "report", "neg_depb_to_oppb", "report", "service_optimization", "report"]. For each report, a sub-folder is created in the output directory (as defined in the :ref:`config`)  named "report_[nr]" with the respective number.

The generation of the report can be modified using flags in :ref:`config`.

1. If ``cost_calculation`` is set, each report will also generate the file "summary_vehicles_costs.csv".
2. If ``extended_output_plots`` is set, more plots will be saved to "extended_plots" in the report directory. These plots include the number of active rotations over time, a distribution of charge types, histograms of rotation consumption and distance as well as station-specific power levels.

.. _cost_calculation:

Cost calculation
################
| **Cost calculation (summary_vehicles_costs.csv)**
| This is an optional output which calculates investment and maintenance costs of the infrastructure as well as energy costs in the scenario. The costs are calculated based on the price sheet, given as input in the :ref:`cost_params`.
| The energy costs and the grid connector costs are specific for each grid operator, as given by the :ref:`cost_params`.
| The following costs are calculated as both total and annual, depending on the lifetime of each component. See `SpiceEV documentation <https://spice-ev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/charging_strategies_incentives.html#incentive-scheme>`_ for the calculation of electricity costs.

* Investment
    * **Buses**: Costs for all buses used in the simulation. Costs include battery swaps, depending on the lifetime of both buses and batteries.
    * **Charging infrastructure**: Costs for all depot and opportunity charging stations, depending on the number of actually used charging stations at each grid connector.
    * **Grid connectors**: Costs for grid connectors and transformers, depending on the voltage level and the distance to the grid.
    * **Garages**: Costs for workstations and charging infrastructure at garages.
    * **Stationary storages**: Costs for stationary batteries at depot and opportunity stations, depending on its capacity [kWh].
    * **Feed-in**: Costs for feed-in (power generation plant such as PV modules) at depot and opportunity stations, depending on its capacity [kW].
* Maintenance
    * Depending on the lifetime of each component maintenance costs are calculated for buses, charging infrastructure, grid connectors,  stationary storages and feed-in.
* Electricity
    * **Power procurement**: Costs for the procurement of energy.
    * **Grid fees**: Costs for power and energy price, depending on the voltage level and the utilization time per year.
    * **Taxes**: Taxes like electricity taxes, depending on given taxes by price sheet.
    * **Feed-in remuneration**: Remuneration for electricity fed into the grid.

As result the following table is saved as CSV. The first two columns of the csv file are "parameter" and "unit" as descibed below. The third column "cumulated" returns the results for the whole scenario. In the consecutive columns, the results for each electrified station are displayed separately. Be aware that:

* Busses, that start or stop at more then one depot are displayed in each column of the respective electrified station, but only once in the column "cumulated", so the sum of all depots in not necessarily equal to the sum of all electrified stations. This is valid for both number of vehicles and investment costs.
* Costs are only calculated for :ref:`electrified_stations`. Vehicles for rotations starting at non electrified stations get added to the column "Non_elctrified_station".

Optimization
------------

There are several options for optimizations that are implemented as :ref:`sim_modes`. These options are currently:

* :ref:`neg_depb_to_oppb`
* :ref:`neg_oppb_to_depb`
* :ref:`Service Optimization`
* :ref:`Station Optimization`

.. _consistency_check:

Consistency check
-----------------

SimBA makes certain assumption, that have to be valid to trust the results. these are:

* The trips inside a rotation are chronologically sorted
* The trip time is not negative, so the arrival of the trip is later or equal to its departure.
* The break time between trips is not negative, so the departure of the consecutive trip is later or equal to the arrival of the preceding trip.
* Each rotation has a defined and fixed depot, so the rotation starts and ends at the same station
* Every trip within a rotation starts where the previous trip ended

In order to test these assumptions, the flag "check_rotation_consistency" can be activated in the :ref:`config`, which will result in the display of cases where assumptions are broken in the console and in the log file. Additionally, the inconsistent rotations can be filtered out of the simulation by setting the "skip_inconsistent_rotations" flag to true.


.. _rotation_filter:

Rotation filter
---------------

Before all rotations specified in the :ref:`schedule` are simulated, there is the option to filter only the ones relevant to for the actual analysis. This is activated by setting the "rotation_filter_variable" in the :ref:`config` to either "include" to consider only certain rotations from the schedule, or to "exclude" to exclude certain rotations from the analysis. The list of rotations for both options is specified as "rotation_filter" in the Path paragraph of the :ref:`config`.

Logging
-------

SimBA uses the "logging" package for logging. All logging messages are both displayed in the console and written to a log file. The filepath and the loglevel can be defined in the :ref:`config`. Four log levels are available in the following order: DEBUG, INFO, WARN and ERROR. INFO includes INFO, WARN and ERROR but excludes DEBUG. Console and file can have a different log level.
