### Input and output files and paths ###
# Input file containing trip information (required)

# Output files are stored here (defaults to: data/sim_outputs)
# Attention: In Windows the path-length is limited to 256 characters!
# Deactivate storage of output by setting output_path = null

# Electrified stations (required)

##### Modes #####
### Specify how you want to simulate the scenario ###
# Options: sim, neg_depb_to_oppb, neg_oppb_to_depb, service_optimization.
# sim runs a single simulation with the given inputs.
# report generates simulation output files, including costs.

##### Flags #####
### Activate optional functions ###
# Set flag for cost calculation: (default: false)

# generate special plots in report mode (default: false)

##### Charging strategy #####
# Preferred charging type. Options: depb, oppb (default: depb)

# strategy to use at depot and electrified station
# refer to https://spice-ev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/charging_strategies_incentives.html

##### Physical setup of environment #####
### Parametrization of the physical setup ###
# Default max power [kW] of charging station at depot and opp stations (default at opps: 300)
# At depot stations opp and depot busses have distinct charging stations (all deps default to: 150)
# Individual cs_power per gc and cs type can be defined in electrified stations
