##### Modes #####
### Specify how you want to simulate the szenario ###
# Options: sim, neg_depb_to_oppb, neg_oppb_to_depb, service_optimization.
# sim runs a single simulation with the given inputs.
# neg_depb_to_oppb changes negative depb-rotations to oppb charging.
# neg_oppb_to_depb changes negative oppb-rotations to depb charging.
# service_optimization finds the largest set of electrified rotations, rotations SOC<0 are removed.
# report generates simulation output files, including costs.

##### Flags #####
### Activate optional functions ###
# Set flag for cost calculation: (default: false)

# Remove rotations from schedule that violate assumptions?
# Needs check_rotation_consistency to have an effect (default: false)

# Show plots for users to view, only valid if generate_report = true (default: false)

##### Physical setup of environment #####
### Parametrization of the physical setup ###

##### Simulation Parameters #####
# Maximum number of days to simulate, if not set simulate entire schedule
