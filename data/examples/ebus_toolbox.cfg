##### SIMULATION HYPERPARAMETERS #####
# set random seed (for always random: set seed = null)
seed = 1

# Specify what you want to do. Options: sim, neg_depb_to_oppb, service_optimization. Default: sim
# sim runs a single simulation with the given inputs.
# neg_depb_to_oppb changes negative depb-rotations to oppb charging.
# service optimization finds the largest set of electrified rotations.
